mobile grocery list for anycook

## Core Idea

Which anycook recipes are favorites around my location?
What do I need to buy for a selected recipe?
With the anycook Einkaufszettel (anycook shopping list) you can add ingredients to a shopping list. Favorite recipes in your location will be highlighted.
